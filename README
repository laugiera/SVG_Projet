*.esvg:
  - svg file with m4 ifdef instructions: ifdef([[EXTRACT]],[[]],[[...]])
  - after executing make, yields to two files:
      .svg file that can be rendered of its own
      .psvg file that is supposed to be inserted into a main svg file

*.fsvg:
  - svg file with m4 include instructions: include(*.psvg)
  - after executing make, yields to one file:
      .svg file that can be rendered

Notes:
  1) Do not forget to insert changequote(`[[',`]]') at the begining of your *.esvg files.
  2) A *.esvg file is not supposed to contain m4 include instructions
as it would suppose to have already produced the included .psvg files.
This kind of dependencies in chain are not compatible with a simple generic Makefile.
However it would be compatible with an ad hoc Makefile describing explicitely all dependencies.
